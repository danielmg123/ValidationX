# Introduction

ValidatorX is a robust and flexible Java validation library designed to simplify the process of ensuring data integrity in your applications. Whether you're building a small form or a complex enterprise system, ValidatorX offers an intuitive and powerful way to validate data using both a fluent API and annotation-based constraints.

## Purpose

The primary goal of ValidatorX is to streamline validation logic so that developers can focus more on business requirements rather than boilerplate error checking. By providing a clear and expressive API, ValidatorX reduces complexity and minimizes the risk of errors during data validation.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity:** Write clear, concise validation rules with a fluent, chainable API.
- **Flexibility:** Combine custom validation rules with standard JSR 380 constraints to handle a wide range of scenarios.
- **Reusability:** Define custom rules once and reuse them across multiple projects.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend ValidatorX with new annotations, rules, and validation pipelines tailored to your needs.
- **Localization:** Customize error messages using resource bundles, making it easier to support multiple languages.
- **Performance:** Designed for efficiency, ValidatorX scales well even in applications with heavy validation demands.

## Key Features

- **Fluent API:** Construct validations with a readable, chainable syntax that keeps your code clean.
- **Annotation-Based Validation:** Use built-in annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Email`, `@Size`, `@Min`, and `@Max` directly on your data models.
- **Custom Rules:** Leverage the `RuleBuilder` and `RuleRegistry` to create and manage your own validation logic.
- **Cascading Validation:** Automatically validate nested objects, ensuring complete data integrity across complex object graphs.
- **JSR 380 Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with standard JSR 380 (Bean Validation) annotations for a consistent validation approach.
- **Flexible Pipelines:** Build and configure custom validation workflows to meet the unique requirements of your application.

ValidatorX is engineered to grow with your project, providing both the simplicity needed for rapid development and the advanced features required by enterprise systems.
